 *if Bottle#1 has 1.1 gram pills, then the total weight of those pills would be
 *1+2+3+4+5+6+。。。。+1*(1.1-0.1) = 210.1
 *if Bottle#2 has 1.1 gram pills, then the total weight of those pills would be
 *210 + 2*0.1 = 210.2
 *.。。
 *if Bottle#13 has 1.1 gram pills, then the total weight of those pills would be

 *From the above, we can conclude that the lable of the bottle is
 *NumberedBottle = (totalWeight - 210)*10
